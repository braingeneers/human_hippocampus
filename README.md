Welcome to the **Human Hippocampus** repository, a research project by the UCSC Braingeneers. This repository houses a set of analytical scripts and Jupyter Notebooks designed to analyze and visualize datasets generated by our group. Whether you're a member of our team or an interested collaborator, this repository serves as a hub for active research and data analysis.

## GitHub Codespaces
Our research team uses Github Codespaces to do research inside of this repository. Codespaces provide a cloud environment where you can work on code for research just like how you usualy do on your personal computer. However, because everything in codespaces happens in the cloud, it provides massive benefits for collaborating on research and sharing your findings with others. Here' we provide a brief introduction to codespace and teach how to get started with doing research...

### Getting Started

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/braingeneers/human_hippocampus?quickstart=1)

To get started with our research and analysis tools, follow these steps:

1. Click the **"Open with GitHub Codespaces"** button above to launch a fully configured development environment with all the necessary tools and extensions.

2. Once your Codespace is ready, explore the `devcontainer.json` file for configuration details. It automatically pulls the latest Docker image from [ghcr.io/braingeneers/research:latest](https://ghcr.io/braingeneers/research:latest), installs essential VS Code extensions (Jupyter, Python, LiveShare), and executes the `post_create.sh` shell script to set up additional features.

3. The `post_create.sh` script is executed after the Codespace container is built and installs the `./src/human_hip` directory as a local library using the command: `python3 -m pip install -e ./src/human_hip --no-deps`. You can import the `fcm.py` file from anywhere within the workspace simply by writing `import fcm`.

4. The `docs` directory has been set up using `sphinx-quickstart` to create a base project Documentation structure. You can add inline documentation (NumPy style) to further enrich our project's documentation. To render the documentation locally, navigate to the `docs/build/html` folder in the terminal and run `python3 -m http.server`.

### Customizing the Devcontainer

The `devcontainer.json` file allows you to customize your Codespace container and VS Code environment using extensions. You can add more extensions to tailor the environment to your specific needs. Explore the VS Code extensions marketplace for additional tools that may enhance your workflow.

### Working with Datasets

Our Docker image contains datasets downloaded from the National Research Platform (NPR) using S3 protocols. These datasets are located in the `/home/joyvan/data/` folder within the Docker container. Keep in mind that this folder isn't in the `workspace/human_hippocampus/` path, so changes won't be included in GitHub commits.

If you need to commit exported data, make sure to save it to the `workspace/human_hippocampus/data/` folder within your Codespace. This way, your data will be included in your GitHub commits and shared with the team.

## Installation with pip

You can install the tools in this repository with pip:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/braingeneers/human_hippocampus.git
```
This command can take a bit of time to run.

Alternatively, one can clone the repository to a specified location and then call:
```
pip install -e [PATH_TO_CLONED_RESPOSITORY]
```
This second option makes it easier for the user to edit the analysis scripts to suit their own needs.

The package and associated modules can then be imported into a python script with:
```
import human_hip.raw_data
import human_hip.spike_data
import human_hip.animate
import human_hip.histology
```
See the tutorials (`tutorials/`) and source code (`src/`) to see what functions are included in each module and how to use them.

The GitHub Codespace makes use of Python 3.10.0 - utilizing this version of Python with oneâ€™s local installation of the package ensures compatibility. Additional dependencies may need to be installed in order to properly run all functions in the toolbox.

## Project Structure

- **src/:** This folder contains scripts and notebooks representing completed work by the team.

- **dev/:** The `dev/` folder contains active research by each contributor on the project.

- **tutorials/:** This folder contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks highlighting how to perform basic analyses and create various animations.

- **pyproject.toml:** This file follows the guidelines from [PyPA](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) for documenting project setup information.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from collaborators and researchers interested in our work. If you have improvements, suggestions, or new findings to share, please submit a pull request. Your contributions help advance our research and analysis efforts.

Thank you for joining us in exploring the fascinating world of the Human Hippocampus! ðŸ§ ðŸ“ŠðŸ“š
