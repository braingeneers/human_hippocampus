    "The question we are attempting to answer is, \"In which survey questions are student responses statistically different from neutral?\" To get analyzable distributions, we label student responses, \"Strongly Disagree\" to \"Strongly Agree,\" from -2 to 2. We then do a T-test to show significance. For the T-test, we must compare the mean and standard deviation of the survey data to a \"null\" distribution. I will define the null to have mean 0, and a standard deviation that's the same as the corresponding survey data. This approach is somewhat hand-wavy. For this paper it's probably sufficient though."
